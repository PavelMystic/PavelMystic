My name is Pavel Kulmon. I am senior researcher at [ERA a.s.](https://www.era.aero/en).

I have a Ph.D. in Systems Engineering from the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en/).

My main interests are in the fields of Bayesian inference, state-space models, Machine and Reinforcement Learning. In all of those fields I am equally interested in theory and applications.
