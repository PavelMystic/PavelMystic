- 👋 Hi, I’m @PavelMystic
- 👀 My main interests are in the fields of Bayesian inference, state-space models, Machine and Reinforcement Learning. In all of those fields I am equally interested in theory and applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mainly about Amortized Bayesian Inference and bridging Statistical Decision Makind and Reinforcement Learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything at least loosely related, I am not picky!
- 📫 The best way to reach me is using my email address Kulmon[at]seznam.cz
